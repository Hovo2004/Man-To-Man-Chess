# Man-To-Man-Chess

This project presents the development of a human vs. human chess game implemented in C# using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). The primary objectives were to enhance the chess playing experience and promote fair play. Key features include monitoring illegal moves, displaying a step log, and real-time tracking of game duration.
By providing players with these functionalities, the project aims to improve gameplay fairness and strategic thinking among players.
